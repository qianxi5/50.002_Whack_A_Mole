# Team 11-4 Computational Structures 1D Arcade Game: Whack-a-Mole!

Started with these constraints we set for ourselves:
- a few physical buttons
- makes use of an arithmetic logic that has a boolean, addition, comparison and multiplier function
- these buttons each contain a built-in led, which will light up, signalling the user to press. more than 1 button can light up together 
- the faster u complete more levels, the higher score you get, cuz score = someTimeFunction*#levelsCompleted
- there is a "tap out" button which the player can request the facilitator to activate in order to stop the game and take the last completed level as the highest score.

Ended up with a rendition of the classic "whack-a-mole game" which has 3 buttons to be pressed around the same time when they light up.
